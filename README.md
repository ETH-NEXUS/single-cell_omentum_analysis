# Single Cell Omentum Analysis

This is a repository of the code and resources necessary to run the downstream analysis described in the paper *cell atlas of the human omentum in health and metastasis reveals mechanisms of  tissue homeostasis and reprogramming in response to ovarian cancer colonization* by Lischetti et al.

## Structure

The repository has the following structure:
- docs: additional readme documents for procedures. Code includes inline comments, but additional details can be found in this folder
- omentum_required: resources and configuration file either mandatory for scripts to run successfully or necessary to replicate the final results
- scripts: collection of scripts used for the downstream analysis and visualization. Each sub-directory includes scripts for a specific analysis type
- snake_files: custom configuration used for the snakemake pipeline
